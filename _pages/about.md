My name is Carissa Medlock. I am a Computer Science Major at Knox College with 6 years of coding experience. My future plans involve a career in videogame development and/or design where I work on videogames that delve into mental health issues such as anxiety, schizophrenia, and others in order to educate the public and make people feel less alone. 

Current Project
======
My current project is a dungeon-crawler game of mystical and fantastical creatures. You play as a slime-esc creature who struggles with schizophrenia. Slowly, the partners you meet throughout the game will be revealed of their true forms or if it was all in your head. 

Coming Soon!
